<h1>üß≠ Policy-Based Routing (PBR) Lab ‚Äì Cisco Network Redirection</h1>

 ### <h2>üß† Objective</h2>

<p>This lab demonstrates how to implement **Policy-Based Routing (PBR)** to override standard routing decisions made by a router‚Äôs routing table. The goal is to redirect specific traffic to a different path based on defined policies, rather than relying purely on the shortest OSPF-learned path.</p>

<h2>üß™ Lab Overview</h2>

<p>The network topology consists of four routers (R1, R2, R3, and R4). Dynamic routing using OSPF is configured across all routers, and DHCP is used to assign IP addresses to end devices connected to R1 and R3.</p>

- R1 and R3 serve as edge routers, each connected to a PC.
- R2 and R4 serve as transit routers, with R4 being the default OSPF path from R1 to R3.
- The PC connected to R1 is assigned IP 192.168.0.2.via DHCP
- The PC connected to R3 receives IP 192.168.1.2 via DHCP.

Initially, traffic from the PC on R1 to the PC on R3 traverses the OSPF-learned default path:

</br><i>R1 ‚Üí R4 (203.0.113.2) ‚Üí R3 (93.0.113.2) ‚Üí 192.168.1.2</i>
</p>
<p>However, I implemented a policy on R1 to force selected traffic to instead take an alternate path via R2, bypassing OSPF preference, even though this link has lower bandwidth (10 Mbps, half-duplex) compared to the OSPF route (100 Mbps, full-duplex).</p>

</br>

<h2>üß™ Result</h2>
<p>After applying the policy route on R1, traffic from 192.168.0.2 to 192.168.1.2 was successfully rerouted through 203.0.113.6 via R2, as verified using traceroute. The PBR forced the router to ignore OSPF's preferred path (R4) and use a manually defined path (R2), demonstrating fine-grained traffic control using PBR.</p>
